## About  

Visual Stress is a common condition that affects an estimated 20% of the population.  This causes issues in the visual cortex of the brain which is commonly experienced by people with dyslexia.  Visual stress however is an entirely separate and distinct condition.  Not all people with dyslexia will suffer from Visual stress and not all people with Visual Stress will be dyslexic.   Visual Stress comes in a variety of symptoms including : 
*	Headaches
*	Blurring of print
*	Noticing white "rivers" running down the page. The white background stands out more than text above it.
*	Losing place within text, skipping words or lines
*	Words appearing to move or jump
*	Eyestrain
*	Difficulty in understanding the text being read
*	Glare on page

Research over the last 20 years has show that using a coloured filter can alleviate the symptoms and increase reading speed by up to 38%. 
As a sufferer of Visual Stress and Dyslexia myself I wanted to create a short test that may indicate if a user has Visual Stress and may benefit from the use of a coloured overlay. It wasn’t until I was working in an optician when I was explaining the symptoms of Visual Stress to a patient that I started to wonder whether my own reading issues were caused by Visual stress.  Since being tested I have found a vast improvement with both Coloured Overlays and Colorimetry glasses. This test does not replace testing done by Optical professionals but may prove a useful tool for users who do not often see an Optometrist or users who may not have considered getting tested.

## User Experience (UX)

## Strategy
### User Stories  

#### Reasons a user may visit the website
* Doing research on visual stress either for themselves of for a family member
* Experiencing symptoms of visual stress and want to test themselves / child
* Trying to find out if using an overlay may increase their reading speed

#### Reasons for the website
* Provide information to users about what visual stress is and how to get additional help
* Provide a way of testing for signs of visual stress
* To demonstrate what it looks like to use an overlay
* Spread awareness of visual stress to a wider group of people. 
  

## Scope
#### What a user may expect
* Easy to navigate website
* Good presentation and visually appealing
* Links and functions work as expected
* Users to find information about visual stress
* Have a way to test for visual stress


#### What a user may want 
* A way to check different coloured overlays
* A way to record down scores
* Information about places that offer additional services
* A way to receive their results
* Information about what their results mean 
* To be able to buy overlays
* A way to contact the the company to ask further questions


#### As a developer / business I expect

## Deployment 

### Adding and Committing files

To add files to the repository take the following steps

In the command line type -
        git add .  
        git commit -m "This is being committed"
        git push

To add all new files or modified file use " ."  - To add a single file use the pathway to the file eg .index.html  or assets/css/style.css
When committing make sure your comments are clear about what changes have been made. 
Pushing will send your work to the repository

### Deployment 

The project was deployed with the following steps

* Logged into git hub
* Clicked the "Settings" button in the menu above the Repository.
* Scroll down the Settings page to the "GitHub Pages" Section.
* Under "Source", click the dropdown called "None" and then select "Master Branch".
* The page will automatically refresh, and a link displaced.  It may take some time for the link to show the website.
* If the page will not load go down to "template" under the "source" and select a template. 
* Scroll back down through the page to locate the now published site link in the "GitHub Pages" section.


### Forking

Forking the GitHub Repository


By forking the GitHub Repository, you can make a copy of the original repository in your own GitHub account.  This means we can view or make changes without making the changes affecting the original.

* Log into GitHub and locate the GitHub Repository.
* At the top of the Repository there is a "Fork" button about the "Settings" button on the menu.
* You should now have a new copy of the original repository in your own GitHub account.

### Cloning 

Making a Local Clone

* Log into your GitHub then find the gitpod repository
* Under the repository name there is a button that says "Clone or download". Click on this button.
* If cloning with HTTPS "Clone with HTTPS", copy this link.
* Open Gitbash
* Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be.
* Type git clone, and then paste the URL you copied earlier.

        $ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
        Press - Enter- Your local clone will be created.
        $ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
                > Cloning into `CI-Clone`...
                > remote: Counting objects: 10, done.
                > remote: Compressing objects: 100% (8/8), done.
                > remove: Total 10 (delta 1), reused 10 (delta 1)
                > Unpacking objects: 100% (10/10), done.
