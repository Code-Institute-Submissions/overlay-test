            <p> This Overlay Test is designed to aid in the detection of signs of Visual stress, the test below will help you to find out if a coloured overlay may increase your reading speed.  This tool is not a diagnosis for Visual Stress but may help identify if an overlay may be useful. The test is best run on a desktop or laptop. If you or you child suffers from reading difficulties, eyestrain or headaches you may want to find out whether or not you have a visual stress issue.  We advise that you have your eyes checked regularly by an Optometrist.

                If you found you achieved more words with an overlay work out how much your reading speed increased by using the calculator below.  We advise that you do the test again now you are used to the test without an overlay and use  this score as your baseline result. Use the highest score achieved as your Top Score.

                    <p>If your wordcount increased by more than 5% an overlay may be helpful. You can find out where to get them and additional advise on our resouces page <a href = "resources.html">here</a> We recommend that you have an overlay assesment carried out by a specialist Optometrist to rule out any additional pathology</p>

                    <p>If your wordcount increased by less than 5%  then an overlay may not be of much use.  If you find it more comfortable to read through an overlay.

                    <p>It doesn't look like an overlay would be helpful at this point. If you are having issues with your vision we recommend that you keep your eye examinations up to date with a local Optometrist. If it has been a while since your last examination maybe it's time for a check up.</p>
