            <p> This Overlay Test is designed to aid in the detection of signs of Visual stress, the test below will help you to find out if a coloured overlay may increase your reading speed. This tool is not a diagnosis for Visual Stress but may help identify if an overlay may be useful. <b>The test is best run on a desktop or laptop.</b> If you or you child suffers from reading difficulties, eyestrain or headaches you may want to find out whether or not you have a visual stress issue. We advise that you have your eyes checked regularly by an Optometrist. Please check out our <a href="resources.html">resources page</a> for more information on Visual Stress and where to get additional support, advise and materials.

                If you found you achieved more words with a coloured overlay, work out how much your reading speed increased by. You can do this by using the calculator below. We advise that you do the test again <b>without</b> an overlay now you are familiar with the test, then use this score as your baseline result. Use the highest score achieved as your Top Score.
